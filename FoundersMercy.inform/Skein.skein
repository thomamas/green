        <result xml:space="preserve">Antenna Control
You float weightless at the port end of a cylinder. Through a surprisingly large window, you can see the station rotating around you, solar panels, and antennas, all backed by a spectacular field of stars.  A short lever extends from the floor, and a yellow cable waves from a small control panel.

It is very cold and dark here in the near vacuum. An airlock door leads starboard.

You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. Now you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. Now you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. Now you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

The panel has no socket.

You hear a human speaking from the audio unit: "RWSS Founder's Mercy, this is OV-4165, over...

"There's really somebody there? We thought your station had been abandoned for kilodays...

"Standby...

"We can have a pod there in about a thousand minutes."


    *** You are not alone. ***


In that game you scored 10 out of a possible 10, in 72 turns.


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, UNDO the last command, or read the CREDITS?
