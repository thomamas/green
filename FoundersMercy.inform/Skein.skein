You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. Now you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

Pod Bay
There are four berths for transit pods. Unfortunately, all are empty. There is also a pile of clutter. It looks like equipment removed to free up space in the transit pods.

A secured door leads starboard.

You've been here before, of course, when other families were leaving. They always had a seat for you, but you stayed behind to care for your parents. And then there was nobody else left.

But this is troubling: you had counted, and you were sure there would be one pod left for you, but there are none.

This is my second released Inform project, conceived and implemented in the last months of 2018.

Thanks to Graham Nelson, Andrew Plotkin, Emily Short, and everyone else who contributed to the Inform and Glulx ecosystem. Thanks also Juhana Leinonen for the Object Response Tests extension, Erik Temple for the Real-Time Delays extension, and Sean Turner for the Plugs and Sockets extension. Exit listing code is inspired by Eric Eve's Exit Lister and keypad code is inspired by Emily Short's Computers.

Antenna Control
You float weightless at the port end of a cylinder. Through a surprisingly large window, you can see the station rotating around you, solar panels, and antennas, all backed by a spectacular field of stars.  A short lever extends from the floor, and a yellow cable waves from a small control panel.

It is very cold and dark here in the near vacuum. An airlock door leads starboard.

You can see a scanner floating here.

Pod Bay
There are four berths for transit pods. Unfortunately, all are empty. There is also a pile of clutter. It looks like equipment removed to free up space in the transit pods.

A secured door leads starboard.

You've been here before, of course, when other families were leaving. They always had a seat for you, but you stayed behind to care for your parents. And then there was nobody else left.

But this is troubling: you had counted, and you were sure there would be one pod left for you, but there are none.

You float weightless at the port end of a cylinder. Through a surprisingly large window, you can see the station rotating around you, solar panels, and antennas, all backed by a spectacular field of stars.  A short lever extends from the floor, and a yellow cable waves from a small control panel.

It is very cold and dark here in the near vacuum. An airlock door leads starboard.
