You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. Now you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

You have walked the entire ring. Everything is as expected, much is not working. Now, it's time to leave: the pods are below Sector 1.
