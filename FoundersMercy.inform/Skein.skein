You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. No, you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

This room serves as an airlock for the pod bay, and holds an old space suit and various machinery such as the atmosphere pump. There is a brass plate on the wall.

There is a secured hatch in the ceiling.

Beside the secured port hatch, a status display shows an error message.

There are four berths for transit pods. Unexpectedly, all are empty.

Pod Bay
There are four berths for transit pods. Sadly, all are empty.

A secured hatch leads starboard.

Someone left an emergency communications unit on the floor.

This is troubling. You counted. You were sure there would be one pod left. There are none.

Sector 1: Crops
You still maintain the crops here. There is a small graveyard and the barn remains from when this was the livestock sector. A pylon stretches up from the ground to the hub of the station. You can walk spinward or antispinward.

There is an open hatch in the ground.

So what if you can't escape in a pod. You will just need to bring a pod here. Time to get the communications module working.
