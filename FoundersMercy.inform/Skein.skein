You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. Now you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

By the way, it should be impossible to put this story into an unwinnable state, so feel free to explore and experiment.

If you are having trouble getting started, I suggest reading A Beginner's Guide to Interactive Fiction by Stephen Granade and Emily Short, available at:

Pod Bay
There are four berths for transit pods. Unfortunately, all are empty.

An open door leads starboard.

There is a pile of clutter. It looks like equipment removed to free up space in the transit pods.

This is troubling. You counted. You were sure there would be one pod left. There are none.

Sector 1: Crops
You still maintain the crops here. There is a small graveyard and the barn remains from when this was the livestock sector. A pylon stretches up from the ground to the hub of the station. You can walk spinward or antispinward.

There is an open hatch in the ground.

So what if you can't escape in a pod. You will just need to bring a pod here. Time to get the communications module working.
