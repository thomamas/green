Today is the day.

You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. No, you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

There is more help available about this topic. Try again if you are sure you need it.

By the way, it should be impossible to put this game into an unwinnable state, so feel free to explore and experiment.

If you are having trouble getting started, I suggest reading A Beginner's Guide to Interactive Fiction by Stephen Granade and Emily Short, available at:

[If you prefer not to be tempted by further hints, you can type "hints off" to disable them.]

By the way, it should be impossible to put this game into an unwinnable state, so feel free to explore and experiment.

If you are having trouble getting started, I suggest reading A Beginner's Guide to Interactive Fiction by Stephen Granade and Emily Short, available at:

  • Reset a circuit breaker somewhere in Sector 2.
  • Now might be a good time to try out the scanner.

By the way, it should be impossible to put this game into an unwinnable state, so feel free to explore and experiment.

If you are having trouble getting started, I suggest reading A Beginner's Guide to Interactive Fiction by Stephen Granade and Emily Short, available at:

It's a mesh platform a little below the hub. You feel much lighter here, and you are very aware of how the station rotates, but everything is okay as long as you don't look down.

You can just reach a red circuit breaker on the hub.

By the way, it should be impossible to put this game into an unwinnable state, so feel free to explore and experiment.

If you are having trouble getting started, I suggest reading A Beginner's Guide to Interactive Fiction by Stephen Granade and Emily Short, available at:

Founder's Mercy is my second released Inform project, conceived and implemented in November of 2018.

Thanks to Graham Nelson, Andrew Plotkin, Emily Short, and everyone else who contributed to the Inform and Glulx ecosystem. Thanks also to Eric Eve for the Exit Lister extension, Juhana Leinonen for the Object Response Tests extension, and Sean Turner for the Plugs and Sockets extension.
