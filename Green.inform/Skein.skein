You close the hatch behind yourself.

Pod Bay
There are four berths for transit pods. Unexpectedly, all are empty.

A secured hatch leads starboard.

Someone left an emergency communications unit on the floor.

[Scene 'Repairing Comms' begins]
This is troubling. You counted. You were sure there would be one pod left. There are none.

[Scene 'Between Repairs' ends]
[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. No, you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. No, you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

You can start by looking around and leaving your initial location.

By the way, it should be impossible to put this game into an unwinnable state, so feel free to explore and experiment.

If you are having trouble getting started, I suggest reading A Beginner's Guide to Interactive Fiction by Stephen Granade and Emily Short, available at:

You close the hatch behind yourself.

Pod Bay
There are four berths for transit pods. Unexpectedly, all are empty.

A secured hatch leads starboard.

Someone left an emergency communications unit on the floor.

[Scene 'Repairing Comms' begins]
This is troubling. You counted. You were sure there would be one pod left. There are none.

[Scene 'Between Repairs' ends]
[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

You need to make three repairs, so you get three hints:

  • Explore a bit more.
  • Reset a circuit breaker somewhere in Sector 2.
  • Now might be a good time to try out the scanner.

By the way, it should be impossible to put this game into an unwinnable state, so feel free to explore and experiment.

If you are having trouble getting started, I suggest reading A Beginner's Guide to Interactive Fiction by Stephen Granade and Emily Short, available at:

  https://brasslantern.org/players/howto/beginnersguide.html

[You can type "hint" any time for contextual assistance. If you prefer not to be tempted, you can type "hints off" to disable hints.]

By the way, it should be impossible to put this game into an unwinnable state, so feel free to explore and experiment.

If you are having trouble getting started, I suggest reading A Beginner's Guide to Interactive Fiction by Stephen Granade and Emily Short, available at:

  https://brasslantern.org/players/howto/beginnersguide.html

[If you prefer not to be tempted by further hints, you can type "hints off" to disable them.]

You hear a human speaking from the audio unit: "RWSS Founder's Glory, this is OV-6958, over...

"There's really somebody there? We thought your station had been abandoned for kilodays...

"Standby...

"We can have a pod there in about one hundred minutes."


    *** You are not alone. ***


In that game you scored 50 out of a possible 50, in 55 turns.
