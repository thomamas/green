You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. No, you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

It's a mesh platform a little below the hub. You feel much lighter here, and you are very aware of how the station rotates, but everything is okay as long as you don't look down.

You can just reach a red circuit breaker on the hub.

You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. No, you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

By the way, it should be impossible to put this game into an unwinnable state, so feel free to explore and experiment.

If you are having trouble getting started, I suggest reading A Beginner's Guide to Interactive Fiction by Stephen Granade and Emily Short, available at:

[If you prefer not to be tempted by further hints, you can type "hints off" to disable them.]

You hear a human speaking from the audio unit: "RWSS Founder's Glory, this is OV-6958, over...

"There's really somebody there? We thought your station had been abandoned for kilodays...

"Standby...

"We can have a pod there in about one hundred minutes."


    *** You are not alone. ***


In that game you scored 50 out of a possible 50, in 55 turns.


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?
