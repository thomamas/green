        <result xml:space="preserve">examining yourself:
As virtuous as ever.

looking under yourself:
You find nothing of interest.

listening to yourself:
You hear nothing unexpected.

Little is to be achieved by that.

taking off yourself:
You aren't wearing yourself.

throwing the scanner at yourself:
You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

showing the scanner to yourself:
The handheld voice-activated scanner you use when working on the station's machines.

[You can ask the scanner for a list of commands by typing "scanner, help" and give it voice commands by typing phrases such as "scanner, scan SOMETHING" or "scanner, open SOMETHING" where SOMETHING is a visible object.]

giving the scanner to yourself:
You can't give the scanner to yourself.

waking yourself:
That seems unnecessary.

kissing yourself:
You don't get much from that.

You achieve nothing by this.

rubbing yourself:
You rub yourself.

waving yourself:
But you aren't holding you.

squeezing yourself:
You might not like that.

burning yourself:
There is no open flame on the station.

cutting yourself:
Imperfect vessel that you are, that is not the answer.

tying yourself to the floor hatch:
You would achieve nothing by this.

There's nothing sensible to swing here.

tasting yourself:
You taste nothing unexpected.

drinking yourself:
There's nothing suitable to drink here.

eating yourself:
You're plainly inedible.

dropping yourself:
You lack the dexterity.

Today is the day.

Before everyone left or died, you celebrated every sabbath here. The altar stands against one wall, and an organ stands against the other.

On the altar is The Founder's Testament.

You can also see the audio unit and a gray cable (plugged into the organ and the audio unit) here.
