Today is the day.

You awake. You are lonely, so lonely. It was a thousand days ago today. All alone these thousand days. Your parents were the last. No, your father was the last. He held on for nearly a hundred days longer. No, you are the last. Alone. Adrift.

But maybe it isn't hopeless. There must still be other people in other worlds, and you think you know how to get there.

Today is the day.

Founder's Mercy is my second released Inform project, conceived and implemented in November of 2018. It should be impossible to put this game into an unwinnable state.

Thanks to Graham Nelson, Andrew Plotkin, Emily Short, and everyone else who worked on the Inform and Glulx ecosystem. Thanks also to Eric Eve for the Exit Lister extension, Juhana Leinonen for the Object Response Tests extension, and Sean Turner for the Plugs and Sockets extension.

You pull yourself up through the hatch and close it behind yourself.

Sector 1: Crops
You still maintain the crops here. There is a small graveyard and the barn remains from when this was the livestock sector. A pylon stretches up from the ground to the hub of the station. You can walk spinward or antispinward.

There is a secured hatch in the ground.

So what if you can't escape in a pod. You will just need to bring a pod here. Time to get the communications module working.

Before everyone left or died, you celebrated every sabbath here. The altar stands against one wall, and an organ stands against the other.

On the altar is The Founder's Testament.

You can also see an audio unit and a gray cable (plugged into the organ and an audio unit) here.

In that game you scored 50 out of a possible 50, in 54 turns.


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?
